## What You’ll Need
- A GitHub account
- Git installed on your machine
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (optional, but helpful)
- Completed CP104 GitHub basics or basic knowledge of Git

---

## Step 1: Clone this repository

<details>
<summary>🤔 What does <code>clone</code> mean?</summary>

Cloning means **downloading a GitHub repository to your own computer** so you can edit files locally.

You’ll use this command so you can make changes using your code editor.

</details>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wlumachinelearning/Learning_Git.git
cd cp164-github-basics
```

---

## Step 2: Check your remote

<details>
<summary>🤔 What is a <code>remote</code>?</summary>

A remote is a version of your project that's hosted somewhere else — like GitHub.

- `origin`: the original repo you cloned from (usually the course repo)

You can use Git commands to sync your local repo with the remote one.

</details>

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see something like:

```
origin https://github.com/wlumachinelearning/Learning_Git.git (fetch)
origin https://github.com/wlumachinelearning/Learning_Git.git (push)
```

---

## Step 3: Pull changes from the remote repo

<details>
<summary>🤔 What does <code>pull</code> mean?</summary>

Pulling means **downloading and merging changes** from the remote repository (like GitHub) into your current branch on your computer.

This keeps your local version up to date with any new updates from your instructor or team.

</details>

```bash
git pull origin main
```

---

## Step 4: Make changes & commit

<details>
<summary>🤔 What does <code>commit</code> mean?</summary>

A commit is a saved snapshot of your changes. Think of it like hitting "Save + Version History" at the same time.

</details>

```bash
echo "hello from cp164!" >> sample.txt
git add .
git commit -m "Added my greeting"
```

---

## Step 5: Push your changes

<details>
<summary>🤔 What does <code>push</code> mean?</summary>

Pushing sends your commits (saved changes) from your computer back to the GitHub repo.

</details>

```bash
git push origin main
```
